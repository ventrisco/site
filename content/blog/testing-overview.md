## Testing Methodology

Before doing any backtests, we have to think through what we're actually going to test. There are times that you may just want to randomly explore data but usually it's best to come up with a really good idea of what you're testing so you can stay focused.

We like using the following structure when thinking through what we're testing:

1. Question
2. Hypothesis
3. Prediction

Nothing fancy here; pretty much what you learned in high school science.

### Question

In order to make money in financial markets, you just have to predict whether the market will go up or down tomorrow. You're predicting a binary event so you can end up trying to ask some general questions like "what makes the market go up"? "What makes the market go down? 

We need to be little more specific. 

Does the yesterday's prices change in the SP500 index predict today's price change in the SP500?

That's a question that we can form a hypothesis from.
